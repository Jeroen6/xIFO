 * @brief   xifo circular buffer with <t>/8/16/32/64 bit elements
 * @details xifo supplies object oriented circular buffer with 8 bit size elements. \n
 * 			To use either as FIFO (First In First Out) or as FILO (First In Last Out)
 * 			You might want to rename this file is you are using a C compiler.
